- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScrabbleScratch
- 👀 I’m interested in technology. Everything related to automation and optimization of processes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Docker and a little bit of MySQL. I'm looking to learn some good things and help others with their projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every project I can. I believe that collaborating with people is the best way to learn the best.
